# DenseUIS Dataset
DenseUIS Dataset – First high-resolution remote sensing dataset for building and road recognition in dense urban informal settlements. Features imagery and annotations from 125 urban villages across Shenzhen &amp; Guangzhou, providing a benchmark for fine-grained urban mapping research.

## Overview

The DenseUIS Dataset (Dense Urban Informal Settlements Dataset) is the first high-resolution remote sensing dataset specifically designed for building and road recognition in extremely dense urban informal settlements, commonly known as "Urban Villages" (UVs).

This dataset addresses the critical gap in existing remote sensing resources, which primarily focus on formal urban structures and lack fine-grained annotations for the unique morphological patterns found in informal settlements.

## Key Features

- High-Resolution Coverage: Contains approximately 100 km² of very-high-resolution remote sensing imagery
- Geographic Scope: Covers 125 urban villages across Shenzhen and Guangzhou, China
- Detailed Annotations: Manually annotated building and road masks with fine-grained labeling
- Unique Focus: Specifically targets the challenging scenario of dense urban informal settlements
- Benchmark Utility: Provides a robust benchmark for evaluating advanced deep learning methods in fine-grained urban mapping


**Will be released upon paper acceptance.**
